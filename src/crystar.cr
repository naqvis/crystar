# `Crystar` module contains readers and writers for tar archive.
# Tape archives (tar) are a file format for storing a sequence of files that can be read and written in a streaming manner.
# This module aims to cover most variations of the format, including those produced by GNU and BSD tar tools.
#
# ### Example
# ```
# files = [
#   {"readme.txt", "This archive contains some text files."},
#   {"minerals.txt", "Mineral names:\nalunite\nchromium\nvlasovite"},
#   {"todo.txt", "Get crystal mining license."},
# ]
# buf = IO::Memory.new
# Crystar::Writer.open(buf) do |tw|
#   files.each do |f|
#     hdr = Header.new(
#       name: f[0],
#       mode: 0o600_i64,
#       size: f[1].size.to_i64
#     )
#     tw.write_header(hdr)
#     tw.write(f[1].to_slice)
#   end
# end
#
# # Open and iterate through the files in the archive
# buf.pos = 0
# Crystar::Reader.open(buf) do |tar|
#   tar.each_entry do |entry|
#     p "Contents of #{entry.name}"
#     IO.copy entry.io, STDOUT
#     p "\n"
#   end
# end
# ```
